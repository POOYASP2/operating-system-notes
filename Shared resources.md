**Q -** what is resource?

> any software structure used by **processes** to **advance** its **execution** like Data structure, set of variables, main memory area, file, set of registers of a peripheral device

We have two types of the resources:

1. Private resource (a resource dedicated to a particular process)
2. Shared resource (a resource that can be used by more tasks)
   1.Shared exclusive resource (a shared resource protected against concurrent accesses that means only one process at a time can use the resource)
